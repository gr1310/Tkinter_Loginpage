# Tkinter_Loginpage
As an extension to the OELP project on Software stack for IoT devices, the login/sign page code using Tkinter.
This project involves the creation of a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library for implementing a Login and Registration page. Once a user successfully logs in, they are redirected to a Dashboard where they can initiate the scanning of nearby Bluetooth devices.

The development of this system was facilitated by utilizing a Raspberry Pi 3 and the Python Bluetooth library, which enabled seamless interaction with the Bluetooth capabilities of the Pi. This allowed for the scanning of Bluetooth devices in close proximity.

User data is stored in an SQLite3 database using SQL queries, ensuring efficient and organized data management. This project combines GUI design, Bluetooth technology, and database handling to provide a comprehensive user experience.
